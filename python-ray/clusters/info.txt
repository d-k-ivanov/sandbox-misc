## Steps for Ray Multi-Machine Cluster Installation

Install the same Python version across all nodes
Install the Ray Module and other packages of same version in each VM virtual environment by using a requirements file

[Optional]
Turn off the firewall on the head node first and then start the ray services.
    systemctl stop firewalld

Start ray as head in one of the VM and ray starts with some port address along with redis password:
    ray start --head

Join others worker nodes in cluster:
    ray start --address='<head node ip>:<head port>' --redis-password='<pwd>'

Connect to Ray cluster with ssh tunneling to Ray Dashboard:
    ssh -N -f -L localhost:8265:localhost:8265 <user_name>@<head_node_ip>

Stop Ray services
    ray stop --force
